            Sarah (name changed for privacy), a 34-year-old woman, was
            struggling with severe depression and self-destructive thoughts,
            feeling isolated and hopeless. Referred to the Women&apos;s
            Mentoring Foundation (WMF) by a concerned very overwhelmed parent,
            she entered a 12-week peer counselling program designed to address
            her unique challenges.
          </p>

          <p className="text-[#374151] leading-relaxed mb-6">
            In the initial sessions, the peer counsellor focused on building
            trust, allowing Sarah to open up about her struggles. Over the
            weeks, personalised support helped Sarah develop coping strategies,
            such as mindfulness and journaling, to manage her depressive
            episodes. The counsellor&apos;s continuous encouragement empowered
            Sarah to see her progress and regain control over her emotions.
          </p>

          <p className="text-[#374151] leading-relaxed mb-6">
            By the end of the program, Sarah experienced a significant reduction
            in her depression and no longer felt overwhelmed by self-destructive
            thoughts. She had built a strong support network and was able to
            engage in daily life with a renewed sense of purpose, marking a
            pivotal turnaround in her mental health journey.
